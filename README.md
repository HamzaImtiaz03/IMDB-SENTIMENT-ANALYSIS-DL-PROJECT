# 🎬 IMDB Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to perform **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews from the **IMDB dataset**. Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, the model classifies reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. The solution also features a user-friendly **Streamlit web interface** that allows real-time predictions. The entire workflow—from data preprocessing to model training and deployment—is included.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dataset**: Utilizes the IMDB movie review dataset built into Keras (top 10,000 most frequent words).
* **Model**: A **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with an Embedding layer for binary sentiment classification.
* **Web App**: A **Streamlit-based UI** enables users to input custom movie reviews and receive sentiment predictions.
* **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding to a fixed length, and decoding for interpretability.
* **Training Strategy**: Incorporates **early stopping** to avoid overfitting and saves the trained model for future use.

## 🧠 Training the Model

### Run Training Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook simplernn.ipynb
```

This notebook covers:

* Loading and tokenizing the IMDB dataset (vocab size: 10,000).
* Padding sequences to a uniform length (500 tokens).
* Building a Sequential model:

  * **Embedding Layer**: 128-dimensional vectors
  * **SimpleRNN Layer**: 128 units with ReLU
  * **Dense Layer**: Sigmoid for binary classification
* Compiling with **Adam** optimizer and **binary cross-entropy** loss.
* Saving the trained model as `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`.

---

## 🔍 Making Predictions

### Run Prediction Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook prediction.ipynb
```

This notebook includes:

* Loading the pre-trained model.
* Tokenizing and padding custom input reviews.
* Classifying sentiment based on a threshold (0.5).

---

## 🌐 Running the Web App

Launch the Streamlit interface:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Open the browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`), enter your review, and click **"Classify"** to see the sentiment result along with a prediction confidence score.

## 🧬 Model Architecture

| Component       | Description                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Embedding Layer | 10,000 vocab size, output dim = 128          |
| SimpleRNN Layer | 128 units, ReLU activation                   |
| Dense Layer     | 1 unit, Sigmoid activation for binary output |

### Training Details

* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Loss**: Binary Cross-Entropy
* **Metric**: Accuracy
* **Epochs**: 10
* **Validation Split**: 20%
* **Early Stopping**: Enabled (based on validation loss)

### Input Preprocessing

* Tokenization using IMDB word index.
* Sequence padding: 500 tokens.

### Output

* **Prediction Score** (0.0 to 1.0)
* **Sentiment Classification**:

  * `> 0.5`: Positive
  * `<= 0.5`: Negative

#### 🧪 Example:

```
Input Review: "This movie was fantastic! The acting was great and the plot was thrilling."

Output:
Sentiment: Positive  
Prediction Score: ~0.81  
```

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Upgrade to advanced architectures like **LSTM** or **GRU** for improved accuracy.
* Integrate visual analytics (e.g., training curves, word importance).
* Extend Streamlit UI to display:

  * Decoded review tokens
  * Confidence bar charts or gauge indicators

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* TensorFlow v2.15.0 may raise deprecation warnings that do not affect functionality.
* Make sure `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` is present to perform predictions or run the Streamlit app.
* Streamlit may require an active internet connection on the first run.
